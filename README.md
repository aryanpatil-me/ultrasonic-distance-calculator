# Ultrasonic Distance Calculator
This project uses an **ultrasonic sensorHC-SR04)** and a **16x2 LCD display** to calculate and show the **average distance** to an object in inches. When the push button is pressed, it takes 50 distance readings, averages them, and displays the result on the LCD.

## Components Used 
- Arduino UNO
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- 16x2 LCD
- Push Button
- 10k&Omega Resistor
- Breadboard & Jumper Wires

---

## Working 
- The system waits for the push button to be pressed.
- Once pressed, it takes 50 distance measurements using the ultrasonic sensor.
- These measurements are averaged.
- The average distance is displayed on the LCD in inches.
